Title: The Shockingly Simple Math Behind Early Retirement
Category: note
Kind: note

There are countless blog posts about how to save for retirement. [In this post](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/) Mr. Money Mustache presents an amazingly simple and shockingly effective way to look at retirement; the amount of time until you can retire is simple a function of your savings rate. What doesn't matter? Your income, your spending, your age, or anything else.

Not only is the equation simple, the idea behind it is very powerful. Looking at the table he presents, you can see that by increasing your savings from 10% to 15% you can chop 8 years off your time until retirement. Wow!

The reason this works? In order to increase your savings rate, you probably have to decrease your spending. This means that you will be able to live off less for the rest of your life. And your money saved will be compounded over time. So, there are some strict assumptions in there. But the idea behind everything is very intriguing, and I suggest you at least [take a look](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/).

I just discovered the Mr. Money Mustache site but already it has become an invaluable resource on financial advice for me. It bucks much of the conventional wisdom and focuses on spending less through decreased consumption, an idea that is close to my heart. Not only does it leads to more happiness, it helps our planet as well. [Read away](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/02/22/getting-rich-from-zero-to-hero-in-one-blog-post/)!
