Title: About Joe

This page needs to be updated. For now please see my [CV]({filename}/pages/cv.md).

<!-- <hr>

I am interested in open data, community driven-development, maps, biking, and a few other things.

Denver > Portland > Santa Fe > Denver

* Spent seven and a half years biking and getting wet in [Portland, OR](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PC5PDlKKIo). 
* I managed data visualization projects at [Periscopic](http://periscopic.com) with clients including the Unicef, Yahoo!, GE, the Economic Policy Institute, and the Hewlett Foundation. 
* Originally, I moved to Portland to attend [Reed College](http://reed.edu) where I majored in Economics and Math. 
* I wrote my [senior thesis](https://s3.amazonaws.com/joehand_blog/Hand_ReedSeniorThesis_2009.pdf) on an economic model fueled by creative destruction, a topic that still interests me today.

I spend my time [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/joehand), cooking, [writing Python](https://github.com/joehand), lifting kettlebells, and walking outside. -->

# About This Website<a name="about-site"></a>

This site runs on the [Python](https://www.python.org/)-Powered [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com) static site generator. 
You can explore the code [on GitHub](https://github.com/joehand/joeahand). 
It is served on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), via [CloudFare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) ([with easy & free SSL](https://sheharyar.me/blog/free-ssl-for-github-pages-with-custom-domains/)).

**Homepage**: 
The homepage data is stored in Google Docs (via [IFTTT](http://ifttt.com)) and visualized with Python ([my Pelican gdocs plugin](https://github.com/joehand/joeahand/tree/master/plugins/pelican_gdocs) and [similar tutorial](http://jlord.us/blog/your-own-instagram.html) for JS version). 
Data is processed on my shiny [Digital Ocean server](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=94657bdeab0c). 
I use a [cron job](http://crontab.org/) to get new data and regenerate the site daily (at the strike of midnight).

**Charts**: 
Coffee chart is made using a `<table>`, CSS, and lots of Joe. 
Daily steps chart is made with the [Chartist.js](http://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/index.html) library.

**Design**: 
I designed the site with a lot of inspiration from others.
Thank you others.
The fonts are [EB Garamond](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/EB+Garamond) and [Open Sans](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Open+Sans), served using [base64 encoding](http://bdadam.com/blog/better-webfont-loading-with-localstorage-and-woff2.html). 
I used [Pure CSS](http://purecss.io/layouts/) as my css foundation.

*It is amazing how many people did great work so I could build a website. Pretty cool.*
