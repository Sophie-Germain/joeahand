Reading the autobiography of Ben Franklin I am struck by the amount of civility that abounds in the congress. People were actually pleasant enough to argue about an issue, compromise, then create a document that everyone liked. Has the character of our person's changed that dramatically.</p><p>This country lacks a solid moral compass. Our effects create the future yet we discard any ideas that take that into account. Everything is about the present. What helps me and now is not soon enough.</p><p>How can our youth understand this idea if the majority of adults refuse to accept the notion?</p><p>There is a moral struggle going on in our country. The right is scared of changes, progress, and new ideas. The left is afraid of shit I dunno- maybe how our country is spiraling down and down with every new law passed.</p><p>Our country was founded on compromise, new ideas, and a basic moral constitution. Where did those founding principles go.</p><p>Would we be able to recognize the benefit of a public hospital or library today. Could those institutions be created in this political climate? I doubt it. The public hospital first proposed required that the government match and private contributions. That would never happen in a million years. What changed?</p><p>Ben Franklin had an interesting line in his autobiography about people's unwillingness to change. He understood that accepting new ideas is difficult unless the situation forces it. How can we put ourselves in situations to force new ideas while remaining comfortable- or is that even possible. Perhaps it is the trickiness of situations that allow us to see situations in new light.</p><p>Franklin was a powerful man, yet he did not act is such a way. Franklin wanted everyone to accept an idea before it was put into practice. He was able to be convincing be trying to find what that person's individual interest or notion was. He then worked to tie that to the big picture.</p><p>Perhaps, we just lack that sort of big picture thinkers. Franklin was able to do a remarkable job of bringing everyone together without forcing one side to concede more than another. He wanted the largest benefit to the public in each situation.</p></article><footer class="post-footer"><a class="small-caps" rel="bookmark" title="Permalink to First Post" href="https://joeahand.com/archive/first-post/"><span class="useicons">&#58882;</span><span class="pub_date"><abbr class="published" title="2011-03-30T00:00:00-06:00"> March 2011 </abbr></span></a></footer></section></div><div class="pure-u-2-24 pure-u-lg-1-5"></div></main><footer role="contentinfo" class="site-footer l-box pure-g is-center"><div class="pure-u-2-5 pure-u-md-1-3"><span class="copyright"> Joe Hand &nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/">© 2015</a></span></div><div class="pure-u-1-5 pure-u-md-1-3"><div class="s-icons"><a class="mail useicons" href="mailto:joe@joeahand.com" rel="me">&#58885;</a><a class="twitter useicons" href="http://twitter.com/joeahand/" rel="me">&#58886;</a><a class="instagram useicons" href="http://instagram.com/joeahand" rel="me">&#58884;</a><a class="github useicons" href="https://github.com/joehand" rel="me">&#58887;</a></div></div><div class="pure-u-2-5 pure-u-md-1-3"><span><a href="https://joeahand.com/about/#about-site">Made By <span class="useicons hand">&#58883;</span></a></span></div></footer></div><script type="text/javascript" data-cfasync="false">
