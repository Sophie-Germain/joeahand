                    </header>
                    <article class="content">
                        <div class="entry-content"> <p><strong><em>Welcome to the most definitive guide ever about the happiest place on Earth. Inside I offer a simple three step fix to finally reach the ultimate goal in life.</em></strong></p>
<p>After reading through top ten list after top ten list, a book about the happiest countries on Earth, surveys about happiness, and even visiting some happy places, I finally found it, <strong>the happiest place in the World</strong>.</p>
<p>Searching Google for <strong><em>happiest place in world</em></strong> yields almost three million results. Millions of top ten lists fight to reach the top ten spots on the first search page. A self-proclaimed grump, Eric Weiner, even took it upon himself to fly around the world searching for the world's happiest place in the book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/044669889X/ref=as*li*qf*sp*asin*tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=smijoe-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=044669889X">The Geography of Bliss</a></a></em>.</p>
<p>Nine different countries and one happy US city later he concludes the destination of happiness can be reached through many paths: &gt;Money matters, but less than we think and not in the way that we think. Family is important. So are friends. Envy is toxic. So is excessive thinking. Beaches are optional. Trust is not. Neither is gratitude.</p>
<p>With so many different ways to happiness how can you know what path is right for you? Perhaps it is not about the journey but the people you meet along the way. The author reconsiders one of the people he met on his journey and decides "happiness is completely and utterly intertwined with other people... happiness is not a noun or verb. It's a conjunction. Connective tissue." So it must be more about the people than the actual place. Now we are left to wonder how to find these relationships that make us happy.</p>
<p>Even after trotting the globe trying to discover happiness he ends his journey "not 100 percent happy. Closer to feevty-feevty." Unfortunately, no one informed him of the true, happiest place on earth. You cannot find it on any of the top ten lists on Google. And no, it is not Disney World.</p>
<h3>The Way to Happiness</h3>
<p>I offer you a simple three step process for the way to happiness:</p>
<ol>
<li>Buy a plane ticket to Denmark. 2.   Pack your stuff, fly there. 3.  Arrive in world's happiest place, be happy.</li>
</ol>
<p>Foolproof right? Year after year Denmark ranks as the "<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7487143.stm">world's happiest nation</a>." So anyone who goes there must be happy. It's the rules.</p>
<p>However, you cannot suddenly become happy by just arriving in Denmark and any fool knows this. <strong>To find true happiness, it must come from within</strong>. Sure you can enjoy a beautiful place, wonderful food, or a great concert. But unless you have the right attitude, nothing external will make you happy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no way to happiness. Happiness is the way. &gt;&gt;<strong>Thich Nhat Hanh</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Cultivating Happiness</h3>
<p>I talked briefly at the end of my last post about planting the seed for this attitude. First you must be aware of what you can and cannot control. Things happen. Great things, terrible things. Unless you are a wizard or have a time machine you are powerless to change the past. But you still have a great power within you.</p>
<p>You have the power to control your thoughts. Every event summons a reaction within your mind. Start to nurture the attitude that you have the superpower of authority over your mind. Be attentive to your immediate response to any external event. Here is your homework assignment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acknowledge your knee-jerk thoughts, becoming aware of them as they develop. *  Remember that you have a superpower. With that power you can control your mind. *   Finally, let the thoughts pass by, as if they were a small cloud in an otherwise blue sky.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Keep the Sky Blue</h5>
<p><em>Cultivate a blue sky in your mind</em>. Actively strive to keep that sky clear of nasty thoughts and intentions-- <strong><em>for that is the only place in the world where you can find happiness</em></strong>. See the clouds, say hello if you like, then watch as they drift out of sight.</p>
<h4>Find Your Smile, Find Happiness</h4>
<p>On the author's final leg of his journey, he recounts a serendipitous meeting with the airport bartender. The bartender's name, of course, "Happy." Without hesitation the author asks him what the secret of happiness is. His answer, simple: &gt;"Just keep on smiling. Even when you're sad. Keep on smiling."</p> </div><!-- entry-content -->

                    </header>
                    <article class="content">
                        <div class="entry-content"> <p>The book Strength Finder 2.0 develops the idea of maximizing productivity through investment in talents. By understanding your talents you can create strengths while also being more engaged in your work. A greater awareness of my strengths will help me achieve more.</p>
<h3>The Strength Equation</h3>
<p>In the book, Strength Finder 2.0, Tom Rath introduces the three concepts of <strong>talent, investment,</strong> and <strong>strength</strong>. By <em>investing</em> in our <em>talents</em> we create <em>strengths</em>. He argues that spending time developing our weaknesses gives less return than developing our talents.</p>
<p>Our economy drastically underutilizes our skills because we fail to focus on our strengths. When you manager fails to focus on your strength you are likely to be disengaged at work. By investing in our weaknesses employers increase the chances that we will become bored and inefficient at work. Rather, Rath suggests we need to focus on our talents to become the best we can be.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You <strong>cannot</strong> be anything you want to be -- but you <strong>can</strong> be a lot more of who you already are.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The key is thinking in terms of talents and strengths, not knowledge and skills. By applying your talents to your interests you can build strengths, regardless of the area of study.</p>
<h4>Talent and Investment</h4>
<p>When we think of the word talent we often think of people who are exceptionally good at something-- Michael Jordan was a talented basketball player or Jimi Hendrix was a talented guitarist. Thinking about your own life, you may be a talented cook or writer. The book defines talent slightly differently from this common conception.</p>
<p>Instead of our common definition, consider talent "a natural way of thinking, feeling, or behaving." While this covers a great deal, I want to focus on the <strong><em>natural</em></strong> part of the definition.</p>
<p>People relate to and understand the world through different means. These ways to relate, or talents, are innate to who we are -- our natural talents. Rather than forcing everyone to conform to one way of thinking, by strengthening our natural abilities we can achieve more and be happier in the process.</p>
<p>This departure differs dramatically from the usual understanding of education. Education works on conforming everyone through the same methods to reach the same goals. By teaching everyone the same we are dramatically reducing the return on that education while boring people to death. Sounds like a lose-lose for everyone.</p>
<p>By investing in people in an individualized way, we create engaged students. Not only does this make the process of education more fun, but we get better results.</p>
<h4>Strengths</h4>
<p>Strengths require both talent and investment. Anybody can develop strengths in any venue of talent. But by focusing on our top talents we maximize the time we spend honing our skills.</p>
<p>Discovering our strengths also makes it easier for us to work with passion and actively engage in something. So without further ado... here are my results.</p>
<h2>My Strengths</h2>
<p>The online assessment takes about thirty minutes and is only available if you buy the book (great marketing). Along with your generic theme descriptions, they give a detailed summary of personal strengths. These are my top five strengths:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learner</li>
<li>Futuristic</li>
<li>Relator</li>
<li>Intellection</li>
<li>Responsibility</li>
</ul>
<p>The rest of the post I will be trying to understand more about myself, my strengths, and how I can apply them. None of them were super surprising. The relator I quested a bit until reading further into my personal summary, then it made sense. There are three sections of the report: <strong><em>awareness, application</em></strong>, and <strong><em>achievement</em></strong>. I will discuss each theme, then move on to the next section.</p>
<h3>Awareness</h3>
<h4>Learner</h4>
<p><strong><em>Generic Description:</em></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>People who are especially talented in the Learner theme have a great desire to learn and want to continuously improve. In particular, the process of learning, rather than the outcome, excites them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds just like me! I love learning. I am a sponge for all information from every source. I always loved school and have continued to learn since leaving school. The personalized description was more interesting.</p>
<h5>Personal Insights</h5>
<p>The whole thing is quite long, so no reason to post here. But I will pick out the things that I am most curious about.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You appear to study human beings the way others study for final tests. Your approach is direct. Your gaze is intense Your interest is sincere.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is great! I am not sure about whether this is how I really approach others. I am usually a pretty shy person, naturally quite introverted. The description talks a lot unusual individuals capture my attention and I become curious about them. I will need to work on developing this part of my learning talents.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chances are good that you will your mind with new ideas by asking questions, reading, studying, observing or listening.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ummmm. Talk about generic statements. How else could one fill their mind?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because of your strengths, you yearn to know a lot. It makes little sense to you to skim through a book and read only the highlights. You delve more deeply into intriguing subjects than most people do. You love to gather all kinds of information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Definitely true. One look at my bookshelves reveal this. I have a broad range of topics that have struck my interest. I usually read enough about the topics until I feel like I have a solid understanding of the issues then move on. Usually I start with the more important and influential books on the subject and move toward a fringe or two that really peaks my learning curiosity.</p>
<p>For learner, I need to work on developing my ability to learn from other people the most. The report also mentions my ability to give counsel to others. Something that I enjoy doing, but do not actually get the chance to much right now. So, reaching out more and developing those relationships may help me build that strength.</p>
<h4>Futuristic</h4>
<p><strong><em>Generic Description:</em></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>People who are especially talented in the Futuristic theme are inspired by the future and what could be. They inspire others with their visions of the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Always thinking about the future, but I need to work on inspiring others with my visions.</p>
<h5>Personal Insights</h5>
<blockquote>
<p>Because of your strengths, you invest considerable time creating the future of your own choosing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am hoping to create my own future as we speak. The most important thing I want to do is invest in my strengths.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Driven by your talents, you feel enthusiastic about life when you contemplate everything you can accomplish in the coming months, years, or decades. You probably need to know what the future holds before you can concentrate on today's activities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Very true. Sometimes it gets to the point where I get little done if I do not know how this helps the future. This can definitely make it difficult to get some things done. But...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You think in terms of possibilities. This allows you to recover from setbacks, problems, disappointments, or even disasters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The upside of looking to the future. There are speed bumps, but they are nothing compared to the long term.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's very likely that you sense your life has deep meaning. With remarkable vividness, you often imagine where you will be, what you will be doing, and what you have the ability to accomplish in the coming months, years, or decades. Your dreams of tomorrow are very alive in your mind today... The question you must answer is this: "How far into the future can I think before my ideas start becoming vague or uninspiring?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Definitely the part of futuristic that I struggle with. I need to balance having a long term vision with the ability to motivate myself to get there. I often abandon projects or areas of study when I get frustrated with the short term and lack the overall vision.</p>
<h4>Relator</h4>
<p><strong><em>Generic Description:</em></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>People who are especially talented in the Relator theme enjoy close relationships with others. They find deep satisfaction in working hard with friends to achieve a goal.</p>

                    <article class="content">
                        <div class="entry-content"> <h3>Enjoying the Music</h3>
<p>I listen to music a lot. While I am not a huge music buff, I like to have stuff playing while I work, cook, clean, or just hang around my house.</p>
<p>Music becoming digital has led to a near infinite selection. Music listeners love this. But it also means more choices, probably <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/27/your-money/27shortcuts.html">too many choices</a>. In my search for music, I would go through the same one of these three directions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find song I want to hear, use iTunes Genius.</li>
<li>Select lots of songs I do not own using GrooveShark.</li>
<li>Choose artist I like, use Pandora.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these services are great. But each has its own drawback. Worst of all, none of them really lead to new music. Reading the blog endorsing the power of new music encouraged me to start my search. I wanted to find something that was not time consuming, had plenty of new music, and some old favorites mixed in. After trying a variety of sources, I finally found the goldmine.</p>
<h4>The Oldie-But-Goodie Sources</h4>
<p>My usual sources for music are great. But they make it hard to find new music.</p>
<h5>iTunes Genius</h5>
<p>The limits and benefits of Genius do not take long to figure out. Great for listening to genres of music you own. Not good for finding new music.</p>
<p>I love the iTunes Genius button. Since they came up with it I basically stopped making playlists. That combined with the time my music library got wiped out losing all my old playlists and ratings.</p>
<p>I use genius when I know what I want to listen to. Let's say I go with a classic like <em>Crosstown Traffic</em> by Jimi Hendrix. iTunes genius gives me a nice selection of rock mixed with some newer pop stuff. All songs I like, definitely a good playlist. But the problem-- I need to own all the music. So then I move on to GrooveShark.</p>
<h5>GrooveShark</h5>
<p>For people who do not know about GrooveShark, I encourage you to check it out now: <a href="http://grooveshark.com/">GrooveShark.com</a>. Two things about GrooveShark encourage me to use it over and over again.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create playlists from many many songs I do not own.</li>
<li>Find music from lists of popular songs.</li>
</ol>
<p>I mostly use this when I know what I want to listen to. Discovering new music on the poplar list is hit or miss. Otherwise you have to know which new music to search for, defeating the point.</p>
<p>GrooveShark also has a radio feature, but in my experience it does not compare to Pandora.</p>
<h5>Pandora</h5>
<p>Of course I have a <strong>Jimi Hendrix</strong> station of Pandora. And the station is great. But the music stays along the same lines as iTunes. I get some music that I do not own and perhaps a few new songs.</p>
<p>If I want to branch out I can start a station with a newer artist. Without a doubt, I have discovered great new music through Pandora. However the stations get stale regardless of where you start. A computer can only reach so far into new genres. I also find myself hitting skip until I find a comfortable song, defeating the whole point.</p>
<p>After creating about 30 Pandora stations I became frustrated and began my search.</p>
<h3>The Search for New Music</h3>
<p>The above three sources of music have provided most of my music the last two years or so. I rarely reach out to find new music. When I started, I realized I had no clue where to turn.</p>
<h4>Asking Friends</h4>
<p>None of my friends really seek out new music. Lots of people do, I just do not know them. If you know the right people this will probably be a great source.</p>
<p>For decades new music gained popularity through the radio, so I moved there.</p>
<h4>Streaming Radio</h4>
<p>I do not own a radio, limiting me to streaming radio. Luckily most radio stations stream now.</p>
<p>I love advertisements as much as the next person. So, I chose to stick with public radio streams only. My dad works in public radio so he had plenty of good suggestions for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>KEXP</li>
<li>The Current</li>
<li>WXPN</li>
<li>WBEZ</li>
<li>NPR Music</li>
<li>Lots more...</li>
</ul>
<p>Each station offers different types of music during the day. Without knowledge of what shows were closer to the kind of music I enjoyed I became frustrated. Plenty of stations also offer streaming of individual shows that I could match with my interests. That conflicts my goal of being time efficient though.</p>
<h4>Podcasts</h4>
<p>The jump from streaming radio to podcasts was easy. Lots of stations offer their shows as podcasts. But once again I ran into the problem of too many choices. Tons of music podcasts fill the iTunes directory.</p>
<p>Staring at the list of top music podcasts in iTunes is a strange experience. I started listening to some from the radio stations I enjoyed more. The experience was again hit or miss. Unfortunately, somewhere in the strange mix of podcasts in the top 10, I missed <em>NPR's All Songs Considered.</em></p>
<h3>The Goldmine</h3>
<h4>All Songs Considered</h4>
<p>After downloading and listening to some other podcasts, I returned to the top 10 disappointed and looking for more. Finally I found it, <strong><em>NPR's All Songs Considered</em></strong>: the perfect combination of new music and old favorites spiced up with great stories and music knowledge.</p>
<p>I am really happy with the podcast because not only do I get to hear new music, but the hosts have a vast understanding of the music. Unlike Pandora, the podcasts can jump from one genre to another while still having a common theme. And in the process of hearing music I am also learning about music-- the best of both worlds!</p>
<p>I have listened to about 30 of the 300 old episodes and am looking forwards to the rest. Best of all, there is a 24/7 music stream if I ever get tired of the commentary.</p> </div><!-- entry-content -->

<p>The things I wrote before were not worth signing. This decreased my motivation to write new posts. So here is to starting fresh--creating something where I will proudly display my seal of approval.</p>
<h3>Riding the wave.</h3>
<p>This fresh start comes on the wave of another new project. Two weeks ago I began a project at <a href="http://smilingjoe.com">SmilingJoe.com</a> called <strong>Experiments in Kindness</strong>. I feel a strange force pulling me forwards. Bringing me towards new opportunities, encouraging me to explore new ways of thinking. It is exciting yet scary. I only hope I can stay above the surf.</p>
<p>But getting knocked down may be a better experience than riding the wave itself. So then I look forwards to whatever lies ahead.</p>

<li>1/2 tsp Sea Salt</li>
<li>1/2 tsp Baking Soda</li>
<li>1 c Brown Sugar</li>
<li>1/2 c White Sugar</li>
<li>3/4 c Butter</li>
<li>1 egg</li>
<li>1 egg yolk</li>
<li>1 tbsp vanilla</li>
</ul>
<h4>Directions</h4>
<ol>
<li>Start by getting all of your ingredients out in one place. That way you will not forget anything. Put things away after each step and make cleaning so much easier!</li>
<li>Mix dry stuff in bowl, set aside.</li>
<li>2 Cups Flour</li>
<li>1/2 tsp Sea Salt</li>
<li>1/2 tsp Baking Soda</li>
<li>Mix sugars and butter in new bowl. Melted butter is easier but changes how dough bakes (<strong>See Note</strong>).</li>
<li>1 c Brown Sugar</li>
<li>1/2 c White Sugar</li>
<li>3/4 c Butter</li>
<li>Mix in eggs and vanilla.</li>
<li>1 egg</li>
<li>1 egg yolk</li>
<li>1 tbsp vanilla</li>
<li>Add dry stuff into wet about 1/2 cup at a time and mix with a gentle force.</li>
<li>Add chocolate chips (about 1 cup but really a personal preference here).</li>
<li>Place on cookie sheet. Make whatever size you want. Bake at 325 for 12ish minutes, until edges are browned.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> The dough (and therefore cookies) is much better if put in the fridge for 24-48hrs wrapped in plastic/tightly covered, especially if you melt the butter. Melted butter makes the dough little tough to work with immediately. Take it out of the fridge 30min before you plan on baking the cookies.</p>
<p>Good luck and enjoy the cookies.</p> </div><!-- entry-content -->
