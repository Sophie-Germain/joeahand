                        <div class="entry-content"> <p>On June 29th 2011, one week and one day after turning 24, I set out on a mission. The mission: make some yummy chocolate chip cookies. Something about making chocolate chip cookies always strikes the right notes with me. When I bake my soul is at ease. Me and the cookies are one. I am not sure what it is; part science, part chocolate, lots of sugar, and of course, smiles. People love cookies and I love making people smile.</p>
<p>After I had lots of cookies, I needed someone to eat them. Deciding to give them to cyclists heading home from work was the easy part. The real inspiration struck me while reading about the ongoing conflict in Ladd's Circle. And so my first Experiment in Kindness was born.</p>
<p>The response of the complete strangers receiving cookies amazed me. I cannot remember a better bike ride than the one returning home after that experience. It did not take long for me to launch <a href="http://smilingjoe.com">smilingjoe.com</a> and make it a goal to keep my experiments going.</p>
<p>Kindness begets kindness. We can each make the world a better place with kindnesses small or large. Even if my experiments fail or stop completely, I know that for that one day, in those 30 minutes, I put smiles on 100 faces and that is enough.</p>

<h4>Me and Writing</h4>
<p>Throughout school I never enjoyed writing. Everything always felt forced as I tried to conform to standards. I ended up writing with someone else's voice leading to terrible papers.</p>
<p>After writing the experiments in kindness and some personal blog posts, I realized how much I enjoyed writing -- on my terms. But I still felt I needed to work on getting my ideas down with clarity and ease. Any writer will tell you that in order to learn how to write, you write, a lot. So, six days ago I made it a goal to post here everyday for thirty days.</p>
<h4>Serendipity</h4>
<p>Five posts later and I am making progress, but sometimes only with great effort and frustration. I still feel like I am <strong><em>finding my voice</em></strong>. As I began writing today I struggled to start. I headed over to <strong><em><a href="http://zenhabits.net">ZenHabits</a></em></strong> by <a href="http://leobabauta.com">Leo Babauta</a>, my favorite source for motivation. Lo and behold, a post on <a href="http://zenhabits.net/voice/">finding your voice</a>.</p>
<p>The first tip as expected, <strong><em>Write a lot</em></strong>. Check. The second tip: &gt;<strong>Experiment boldly</strong>. Rip off the greats, and the goods as well. Mimic and make it your own. Try and err.</p>
<p>I kept reading and within moments I began seeing how finding your voice parallels finding your smile. I decided to "rip off the greats... mimic and make it my own." And thanks to ZenHabits being in the <a href="http://zenhabits.net/open-source-blogging-feel-free-to-steal-my-content/">public domain</a> I could do so easily.</p>
<p>Thank you Leo for all the great posts and inspiration. If I could only read one blog the rest of my life, I would choose ZenHabits. I encourage everyone to check out <a href="http://zenhabits.net">ZenHabits</a>. <strong><em>The remainder of this post was stolen from there and modified without regret.</em></strong> I lay claim to none of the hard work and words you will find below.</p>
<h3>Finding Your <strike>Voice</strike> Smile</h3>
<p>Humans of any kind must find their smile.</p>
<p>We are writers, musicians, designers, programmers, parents, builders of anything. But we are not truly at peace with ourselves, and genuinely happy, until we've found our smile: the attitude, kindness, compassion, love, personality we use to express ourselves.</p>
<p>Our smile is our essence, plain for the world to see.</p>
<p>A fellow happiness seeker asked me how I found my smile. And I have no easy answer -- I'm not even sure I can say I've fully found my smile yet. It's a quest that doesn't seem to end -- not a Grail quest, really, but a constant retuning as the essence of who I am neverendingly changes.</p>
<p>But I feel I've found something that has the texture of truth, even if only a tactile approximation. I'll share some of my thoughts, but keep in mind I don't hold the answers firmly at all.</p>
<p>I'm learning, and I hope my learning helps yours. This is written for smile seekers, but the ideas are the same for anyone who is human.</p>
<p><strong>Smile a lot.</strong> This is almost all I need to say, as nothing else matters without the constant practice of smiling a lot. Try smiling right when you wake up, when you are washing dishes, smile to strangers, find your enemies and smile with them, smile at nature, and smile for yourself. The sheer mass of your smiles becomes the raw matter from which to chisel your happiness.</p>
<p><strong>Experiment boldly.</strong> Rip off the greats, and the goods as well. Mimick and make it your own. Try and err.</p>
<p><strong>Learn to be at peace with yourself.</strong> My smile is really the happiness in my head. It's not how I assert my happiness, but how I feel my genuine happiness, in the noisy cavern of my skull. I listen to my inner peace and that's the smile I try to emulate.</p>
<p>Getting that happiness from your head to your face -- that's the trick. It's not easy, but again, do it often, and you'll get proficient at it. It's a rewiring of the synapses, so that your head-happiness shoots down into your face muscles and come out as a smile, as kindness and compassion. Most people don't do this enough to get good at it, and so there is low fidelity.</p>
<p><strong>Find what feels true.</strong> You'll smile a lot, and most of it will be bullshit. You need bullshit if you want to find the truth. Sort through the bullshit until you recognize the truth, by feel, not by and logical criteria. The truth looks remarkably like bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>Find clarity.</strong> Good smiling, it's been said often, is inner peace. If your inner peace is muddled, your smile will be. I'd recommend a self-taught course on meditation, but really I've found it's a matter of simplifying. Practice removing external desires and agendas until you have only what's needed to express a simple smile.</p>
<p><strong>Remove the negativity.</strong> It's a process of subtraction more than addition. Most people end up with too many feelings, because they never subtract. Negative feelings get in the way of your smile, so pare it down, trimming the cynical from the bush until you're left with truth. I subtract in my head, these days, but that's from years of practice. After you react, acknowledge your feelings, and remove the negativity.</p>
<p>Most people also have too many detrimental feelings in their own lives to hear their own optimism. Too much is going on around them, and online, and they have no time for solitude. You can't hear your happiness, your inner peace, without solitude. Remove the negativity in your life as well.</p>
<p><strong>Use your smile.</strong> You don't embark on a quest for your smile just for the sake of beauty -- a noble pursuit, but it's not enough.</p>
<p>You must use your smile. Use it to express your happiness, to help others, to change the world.</p>
<p>I smile for kindness in a world that's needlessly barbarous.</p>
<p>I smile for inner happiness to stem the tide of seeking happiness through consumerism.</p>
<p>I smile for contentment because too many feel a lacking.</p>
<p>I smile for compassion because my heart breaks at the cruelty of our species.</p>
<p>I smile for morality in an increasingly unethical world, especially in the growing private sector.</p>
<p>This is how I use my smile. How will you use yours?</p>

                        <div class="entry-content"> <p><strong><em>Baking cookies and finding happiness are mostly the exact same thing.</em></strong></p>
<p>I love baking chocolate chip cookies. For years I have worked to make my cookies better: slightly varying the amount of one ingredient or another, changing the baking time or temperature. Sometimes I fail terribly but most lead me closer to the ideal form of the chocolate chip cookie I am searching for.</p>
<p>Making cookies involves combining certain ingredients in a certain manner and then acting on that mixture by putting them in the oven. I really like brown sugar and chocolate chips. I also like pizza. If I decided to make cookies replacing flour with pizza and the butter and eggs with more sugar and chocolate, I will end up with a mess in my kitchen and no cookies. I can also create the perfect combination of the necessary ingredients then put them in the microwave to bake. Once again, no cookies and messy kitchen. Perfecting cookies requires perfecting the two essential parts: right ingredients and right baking.</p>
<p><img alt="Cookies" src="{{" title="site.imgpath }}/cookies_two.jpg &quot;Cookies (Credit:Joe Hand)&quot;;Cookies (Credit:Joe Hand)&quot;" /></p>
<p>Sadly humans have not always known how to make cookies. We learned, we experimented, and even still some people like one type of cookie over another or less sugar and more chocolate. With happiness we each have our own brand of happiness. But just like you cannot make cookies from pizza, you cannot make happiness from anger.</p>
<p>We all have a common cupboard from which we pull our ingredients for happiness. Pursuing happiness entails learning which ingredients suit you and acting on those ingredients correctly. <strong><em>Right mind and right action.</em></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first step in seeking happiness is learning. We first have to learn how negative emotions and behaviors are harmful to us and how positive emotions are helpful. &gt;&gt;<strong>The Dalai Lama</strong>, The Art of Happiness <small>(p 38)</small></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The Power of Our Mind</h3>
<p>In my definitive guide on <a href="{{ site.production_url }}/2011/happiest-place/">the happiest place on Earth</a> I told you about your superpower. Humans have the amazing power to change how their brain works and control our own minds. Pretty fascinating really, if you like that neuroscience stuff. The process of learning builds new neural pathways within our brain. In English, that means when we do something a lot our brain gets more efficient working in that way.</p>
<p>Think about the brain as a network of roads of all sizes and shapes. Our habits, the things we are really good at, use the superhighways that we build over time by doing that action again and again. Meanwhile, if we go to learn a new foreign language we start the process of creating a new road from scratch-- or perhaps you know a few words and have a trail through the woods.</p>
<h4>The Highways of Happiness The first step in discovering happiness is learning. We have taught our brain throughout life to respond in certain ways. If we regularly get angry or upset-- that is the highway in our brain. Meanwhile, the highway of compassion or kindness may be non-existent. Without building the habits of happiness producing thoughts, we cannot expect to be happy.</h4>
<p>In <em>The Art of Happiness</em>, The Dalai Lama describes his reaction to tragic or sad events as causing a "ripple on the surface of an ocean" which does not effect him deep down. He has a happiness super-highway from a lifetime of training. But if you have a disposition towards anger, an event that upsets you skips the happy highway. Instead your thoughts opt for the anger highway because it is the path of least resistance. What could be small ripples turns into bigger and bigger waves the further it proceeds down that road.</p>
<p>We must habituate ourselves to create new mental pathways while destroying the old edging us ever closer to the right attitude and therefore happiness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Happiness depends more on the inward disposition of mind than on outward circumstances. &gt;&gt;<strong>Benjamin Franklin</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Happiness as a Math Problem</h3>
<p>The mathematical beauty of baking attracts me to making cookies. I love to understand how certain ingredients combine with others. I learned how baking soda or baking powder create different reactions, how a yolk or egg whites change the cookies. Then comes the ultimate problem of finding the correct dough size, oven temperature, and baking time.</p>
<p>Developing the right attitude of happiness works the same way. With every action or thought we have the chance to either lead us closer or move away from our goal. When learning how to be happy, we must realize two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Positive thoughts and actions generate more positive thoughts and actions. *    Negative thoughts and actions propagate to make us angrier, which leads to more negative actions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Act Now</h3>
<p>For every negative thought you discard and turn into a positive, they do not simply cancel out. Wake up the day and start with a positive thought rather than "ugh morning." This one thought will build on itself turning the day around. Looking at our attitude in relation to others we see the true power of the math of happiness.</p>
<p>Just like in our own minds, negative emotions hurt others and cause more waves of sadness throughout the world. Whereas right mind, right action spreads more happiness.</p>
<p><strong><em>So which side are you on? Do you want to make your family, your community, and the world more miserable? Or do you want to propagate joy?</em></strong></p>

                        <div class="entry-content"> <p>The battle of genuine happiness and short-term happiness is a battle between beasts and humanity. Which side are you on?</p>
<p>The fate of mankind rests on the ability for individuals to pursue happiness. Throughout life people seek to maximize happiness and minimize suffering. But in order to succeed, we must work together.</p>
<h4>Teaching Happiness Strangely many of us go through more than twelve years of schooling without ever taking a class on how to be happy.</h4>
<p>Perhaps finding happiness is so easy we do not need to teach it. Or maybe we learn how to be happy in every class because of the importance of happiness. No, the responsibility must fall on parents to teaching kids how to be happy. Well surely happiness cannot be taught, it must be learned from life. Yes, that <em>must</em> be the answer, <strong><em>you learn how to be happy by living</em></strong>. Therefore, every adult has the duty to show children how to live with genuine happiness.</p>
<p>When a parent tells a child to eat their veggies or to stop watching TV and do their homework, they do so for the child's own good. Parents force the child to forgo the short-term sensory happiness of television for their long-term happiness. The child may not agree or understand how studying will make them happy, but the adults know. Yet so many adults act like children when seeking happiness.</p>
<h4>Immediate Happiness Short-term interests plague the country. Looking at any of the problems the country faces-- economic issues, obesity, never-ending legal battles, or war-- adults everywhere pursue the quickest route to pleasure mistaking it for happiness. Sadly, many of these actions ignore the personal and social consequences over time.</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Our tendency is to rush in and do what seems to promise the shortest route to satisfaction. But in doing so, all too frequently we deprive ourselves of the opportunity for a greater degree of fulfillment. &gt;&gt;<strong>The Dalai Lama</strong>, Ethics for the New Millennium <small>(p. 53)</small></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The harmless super-sizing of a meal, fighting for every cent of profit, or neglecting a group of people for the richer lobbyists on the other side-- all of these actions feel great right now. They feel like the path to happiness. But these acts only lead to a desire for more. More food, more money, more power. Gluttony precedes more problems. <strong><em>When our indulgence causes suffering for others is when we lose our humanity and become beasts.</em></strong></p>
<h3>The Humanity of Genuine Happiness</h3>
<p>Genuine happiness. A tricky idea. Too often our desire for satisfaction leads us to satiating our brute impulses, mistaking them for happiness. But rather than seeking happiness externally, we must realize that happiness is not a thing that can be reached but an attitude, a state of being. More importantly, the right actions follow from right attitude. But, here comes the real shocker, right actions help on the path to right attitude. Showing kindness, compassion, love, or concern for others does not diminish the sense of yourself.</p>
<p>Whether you like it or not, you are dependent on others and others on you. This is the beauty of humanity. If we all work for personal pleasure while making others suffer, we will all suffer. But everyone can pursue happiness together and we can all enjoy a bigger slice of the pie.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We come into the world as the result of others' actions. We survive here in dependence on others. Whether we like it or not, there is hardly a moment of our lives when we do not benefit from others' activities. For this reason, it is hardly surprising that most of our happiness arises in the context of our relationships with others. &gt;&gt;<strong>The Dalai Lama</strong>, Ethics for the New Millennium <small>(p. 62)</small></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Act Now</h3>
<p>Developing a sense of inner peace and the right attitude can take years or a lifetime. It can only be achieved through patience and hard work. But nothing stops you from helping others on the path to genuine happiness. The remarkable thing is, it will help you along your path too.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Worry less</em></strong> about your own suffering or sadness. * <strong><em>Show concern</em></strong> for a friend or stranger. *  Guide them towards happiness with <strong><em>compassion and kindness</em></strong>. *  Realize you have just taken a step towards your own happiness.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Do you want to be an animal or a human?</h5>
<p>Are you going to make your inner child eats all the veggies before it leaves the table? Or learn something rather than watch TV?</p> </div><!-- entry-content -->

                    </header>
                    <article class="content">
                        <div class="entry-content"> <p>The nation is reaching the <strong>National Bullshit Ceiling</strong>. Young generations are becoming completely dismissive of politics leaving a nation without leaders. Without bold truth-telling action, the nation will "default on reality". But that would just be the beginning of our problems. Future generations may become completely dismissive of politics leaving a nation without leaders.</p>
<p>The Daily Show recently discussed the National Bullshit Ceiling and the threat it poses to the country. Daily Show correspondent, Jason Jones, warned us of the impending doom if we pass the limit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we reach the point where the amount of bullshit exceeds the amount of things we will effectively default on reality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We already see how this political culture affects our current environment. Our representatives argue with false pretenses. We disregard the truth for the sake of profit or ideology. Individuals now get identified by their parties not what they represent. However, the real harm will be passed on to future generations.</p>
<p>The true damage of the current political culture comes in the form of the dissatisfaction and ambivalence of young voters, which I myself am a part of. I find myself increasingly discouraged by politics. I do not see significant progress being made and am especially frustrated by how we value short-term rewards over long-term investments. I will be the first to admit, I am as guilty in my apathy as any other young voter. I have only been motivated to vote in one of the six elections I could vote it. Take a guess which one (hint: it involved the promise of change).</p>
<p>In the short-term, young generations will be poorly represented and discriminated against in policies. But long-term effects will be catastrophic. <strong><em>As a generation we are being raised with a distrust towards politicians</em></strong>. We see a lack of ethics our leaders and develop a pessimistic attitude, sometimes completely dismissing anything political. What will happen when the young become the old and the country needs people to run it? Who should we look to as role models?</p>
<p>I started this post with the idea of motivating myself and other young voters to care about politics. As I continue in my exploration, I keep wondering, why should we care? The future is a long ways away, yet many of the politicians do not think beyond the past. How could they possibly help us? But it's we who need to help them.</p>
<h3>The Beasts of Politics</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Politics devoid of ethics does not further human welfare, and life without morality reduces humans to the level of beasts. This leads some of us to refrain from politics altogether, but politics is not axiomatically dirty. Rather, the misguided instruments of our political culture have distorted our high ideals and nobel aspirations. &gt;&gt;<strong>The Dalai Lama</strong>, How to See Yourself as Your Really Are</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our political culture is one of beasts. There is no doubting that. But by refusing to engage our leaders, we are just as guilty of driving our country towards failure. We need to take initiative and hold our leaders accountable. We need to set an example of truth telling and living with integrity. Every interaction, every discussion, every decision we make either compounds the problems or helps to solve them.</p>

<p>In the Daily Show clip, Jason Jones called for action. He proposed a solution of "replacing shit with FARTS from our BUTTS." Beyond the obvious comical genius here, the Daily Show team was spot on calling for:</p>
<ul class="no-bullet" style="position:absolute; margin-left:200px; margin-top:0px; ">   <li><b class="big">B</b>old</li>    <li><b class="big">U</b>ncompromising</li>  <li><b class="big">T</b>ruth</li>   <li><b class="big">T</b>elling</li> </ul>

<ul class="no-bullet">  <li><b class="big">F</b>actual</li>     <li><b class="big">A</b>ssessments of</li>  <li><b class="big">R</b>eality based</li>   <li><b class="big">T</b>ruths</li> </ul>

<p>We do not just need this from our politicians, we need this to permeate throughout our society.  Our apathy encourages this culture to strengthen and infect more of our citizens and representatives. Start a revolution by having the courage to stand up and demand an end to bullshit.</p>
<h5>Act with integrity, act boldly, challenge the bullshit.</h5>
