                        <div class="entry-content"> <p>I feel like the biggest driving issue with digital books is the container. Once the container gets standardized, the content and usage can become more standardized. So I guess the question is how to you become the standard container for a type of information. I would imagine the book had some sort of competition, people who bound the pages in a different way or presented ideas differently, right? It does not really sound right.</p>
<p>I wonder if we are too stuck on the idea of a <em>book</em>. Does a remix machine need even to have that idea. There is definitely some idea of cognitive location within an argument. Without knowing how long the argument lasts it may be difficult to focus or understand what the writer is saying. But how can we say that when have books that range from 50 pages to thousands. We have messages that are limited to 140 characters and messages that are unlimited.</p>
<p>When information first started to be communicated over wires a new neo-language had to be invented to convey the message. Then in order to protect privacy and save money people went further to create secret languages on top of this neo-language. That is a pretty powerful idea.</p>
<p>Just by having this standard means of communication people were able to be so innovative around it. Was it the standardization or the uniqueness or what? It seems like the morse-code telegraph broke so many boundaries it had to be a hot bed ripe for innovation. So how do you create that kind of atmosphere around a product.</p>
<p>Does it tell a story? Or connect people? Or just provide economic advantage?</p>
<p>Maybe our thinking is indeed too narrow. Is the portal or the container more important. I think of Google as a portal. iTunes is more of a container. Both are powerful market movers.</p>
<p>Google has used the portal to become a container for other types of goods. What gave them an advantage here?</p> </div><!-- entry-content -->

                        <div class="entry-content"> <p>Both Ken Robinson and Seth Godin preach similar sentiments. Each encourages us to start doing something we love and share that gift with others. By doing something we love we become more energized by doing that thing. That allows us to share even more with the world. At the same time, when we do something we love, the opportunities change in our lives. By living through our passion we can reshape our lives to become something better.</p>
<p>'Be the change you want to see in the world' -Ghandi</p>
<p>Just like an angry person cannot bring world peace, you must follow your passion to live a fulfilling life. The difficulty comes in finding what that passion is.</p>
<p>Where have I found myself to be passionate? When have I done something where I lose all track of time? What activities give me energy?</p>
<p>These are all very interesting questions that are difficult to answer. I can think back about what I have done in the past that fueled me, but what if that has changed. I can think about what I am excited about in the future, but is that enough to drive my life forwards.</p>
<p>I am passionate about happiness in a way that others do not seem to be. I am passionate about being myself, caring, kindness. I strive to be the best person I can be, and I enjoy spending time understanding how I can do that.</p>
<p>I love new ideas. I love seeing new ideas change others even more. But how can that help me find my tribe?</p>
<p>Maybe I should have been an engineer or architect. What if that is what I was meant to do? How would my life path look different had I pursued that passion?</p>
<p>I want to write more today. Yesterday I proposed a post about the overarching goal of Seamless. Perhaps that is too grand of a topic. I am distracted. The resistance is pulling me away. Should I give in? Should I keep writing?</p>
<p>Maybe my passion is just as the quote from Ghandi above. Perhaps I can find my passion by being the change I want to see in the world.</p> </div><!-- entry-content -->

                    <article class="content">
                        <div class="entry-content"> <h3>Intro to Pilates</h3>
<p>Joseph Pilates founded pilates to help bed ridden patients begin injury recoveries. Bed ridden or not, I have my share of injuries and imbalances. By focusing on moving from your powerhouse, Pilates helps teach your body proper alignment and movement using your core muscles- a powerful idea.</p>
<p>I first tried Pilates when my mom gifted me with a private session with her teacher. Walking into a Pilates studio is intimidating. There are a myriad of strange machines with straps and springs. There are all sorts of balls and oddly shaped equipment.</p>
<p>My first lesson was an awakening. I had never felt that sense of control while feeling so out of control.</p>
<h4>Using your powerhouse</h4>
<p>If you had a powerhouse why would you not use it? Well, good news, you do! The powerhouse idea in Pilates establishes the base of every movement. Imagine a rectangle going from your pelvic floor to your shoulders enclosing everything in between. That is your powerhouse. Deep inside your core you have hugely strong and expansive muscles that pull everything from your pelvis, spine, and organs together. Pilates teaches you to initiate each movement with that base and then engage the isolated muscles.</p>
<p>Moving from the powerhouse is a powerful idea. By requiring that movement start and end in the center of the body- Pilates teaches you to move with utmost control, focus, and breath.</p>
<h3>Pilates for Men, the book</h3>
<p>After some major injuries I came back to Pilates with the hope of becoming injury free. I failed then and that is why I return once again.</p>
<p>The goal this time is much more substantial and focused. My overriding goal is to become injury free- and stay that way. After looking through the book I understood that by making it to the end I would achieve that goal. So I set up a fake goal. I want to become an advanced Pilates and Yoga dude. In the process I hope to rid myself of injuries and gain a new sense of bodily balance.</p>
<h3>Dunking</h3>
<p>In the end, I really want to dunk.</p>
<p>The basketball rim sits at 10 feet high. The ball either goes in or it doesn't There is some fantasy aspect about dunking. The image of flying high to pack it down is unyielding. Always a little bit higher. You either get there, or you fail.</p> </div><!-- entry-content -->

                    </header>
                    <article class="content">
                        <div class="entry-content"> <p>I have been struggling to start. When I do start, I lack the patience to finish. This blog for example: I excitedly created the site, wrote the first post, and then waited, but nothing happened. For some reason the blog did not blossom like I had imagined.</p>
<p>Ben Franklin knew how to start his writing career. At thirteen, Franklin started by rewriting other's work. He never stopped. Shortly after he was submitting letters to the local paper under a fake name. Throughout his life he pushed new ideas forward. Ben Franklin initiated, just look at the list: successful printing shop, library, volunteer firehouses, safer fireplaces, bifocals, electricity. By poking the box, he became one of the most influential people of his era.</p>
<h4>Poke the box</h4>
<p>In his book, Seth Godin stresses starting and shipping - a blog post, a worldwide revolution, or helping a stranger unprompted - ship something new however large or small. The default, the safe thing to do is nothing. If you create enough then you will fail. Leading the reader by the hand and acknowledging all bad that may come, the book forces the reader take action. Without failing there cannot be success.</p>
<p>Throughout reading the idea of creative destruction was in my mind. Joseph Schumpeter proposed entrepreneurs drove the growth of the economy through creative destruction. Entrepreneurs are driven to markets where monopolies are coasting on old technological innovation. All of the new entrants attempt to create a more efficient technology. One successful innovation topples the old monopoly while creating a new one. The growth of the economy depends on the number and success rate of the entrepreneurs. With barriers to innovation at a low, this idea is more powerful than ever.</p>
<h3>Creative Destruction of the self</h3>
<p>Creative destruction has always described the economy, but what about a person? When I lift weights- that is creative destruction- I am destroying my muscle fibers to encourage them to grow back stronger. This is what Seth proposes.</p>
<h4>Create a new you: start</h4>
<p>This week I made the goal of doing getting 100% injury free. Using my awesome book, <em>The Complete Book of <strong>Pilates for Men</strong></em>, I planned my first mini-goal. I scoped out the <em>advanced reformer on the mat workout</em> and set it in my sights. About half the exercises looked impossible, but not quite.</p>
<h5>Start small</h5>
<p>I started with a simple 20 minute workout every morning, the <em>beginner mat workout</em>. A huge red X went on my calendar after each completed workout, the Jerry Seinfeld method. One week later I feel a bit stronger. But I really need to push the box.</p>
<h4>Deliver on that new you: ship</h4>
<p>Creating a plan and starting is good. The real goodness comes from shipping. In one month my calendar may be full of red- what then? Well, I will have a stronger core, maybe I will love Pilates or hate it. Cool, that does not sound so bad. In one year my calendar may be full of red- what then? My body will be stronger than ever. Even a third of the way through the book, my body moving in a way that was once impossible. Down the road, when I am 80, I may even be doing the stuff Joseph Pilates did.</p>
<h4>Failure or success is irrelevant if you progress</h4>
<p>In committing to do Pilates for thirty days I know I will push the box. So what if the Pilates space in my box never expands again. It has been pushed, it was not worth it, my box expanded and I moved to push elsewhere- maybe yoga. Then the process starts all over again. Always moving outwards.</p>
<p>I imagine myself testing to optimize my personal self. The goal of my life is to expand. Right now, I need to find where there are maximum returns, just as the entrepreneurs do in the creative destruction economy.</p>
<p>The markets where monopolies sit tantalize entrepreneurs. If they succeed in overthrowing the monopoly the rewards are great. They become the new monopoly. Markets where profits are small or levels of technology superior provide no motivation.</p>
<h5>Where is your personal monopoly?</h5>
<p>Part of you is stuck in routine. It refuses to change. You act the same way in certain situations, always acknowledge people in the same manner, or pick the same thing every time. Just once try act differently, see how it feels, let it soak in. Rinse and repeat.</p>
<p>In the economy one entrepreneur succeeds because so many others fail. If it was one entrepreneur vs one monopoly, I'd put my money on the monopoly. One million entrepreneurs and it is a different story. That is why the value comes from poking the box again and again not doing it once.</p>
<h3>Everyone poke together now</h3>
<p>It is scary to think about a world where every person is as determined as Ben Franklin was. Scary because of the amount of astonishing things that could be done. While each person has their own box to push, it is not all that gets pushed.</p>
<h4>One box growing encourages another</h4>
<p>One day someone in the neighborhood decides to push; she smile and says hello to everyone passing- a stranger smiles back. She watches his box expand as he walks away. A smile is one thing, but Ben Franklin reached for much more than just kindness towards strangers. At first he pushed to expand his own box, then that of the local paper, he did not stop until he made a huge dent in all of mankind.</p>
<p>With each small poke the boxes that enclose us grow; first the box of your house, then your neighborhood, and if you poke hard enough eventually you will push the box of all humanity further.</p> </div><!-- entry-content -->

                        <div class="entry-content"> <p>I struggle to comprehend how our country has changed since its founding. Reading the autobiography of Ben Franklin I am struck by the amount of civility that abounds in the congress. People were actually pleasant enough to argue about an issue, compromise, then create a document that everyone liked. Has the character of our person's changed that dramatically.</p>
<p>This country lacks a solid moral compass. Our effects create the future yet we discard any ideas that take that into account. Everything is about the present. What helps me and now is not soon enough.</p>
<p>How can our youth understand this idea if the majority of adults refuse to accept the notion?</p>
<p>There is a moral struggle going on in our country. The right is scared of changes, progress, and new ideas. The left is afraid of shit I dunno- maybe how our country is spiraling down and down with every new law passed.</p>
<p>Our country was founded on compromise, new ideas, and a basic moral constitution. Where did those founding principles go.</p>
<p>Would we be able to recognize the benefit of a public hospital or library today. Could those institutions be created in this political climate? I doubt it. The public hospital first proposed required that the government match and private contributions. That would never happen in a million years. What changed?</p>
<p>Ben Franklin had an interesting line in his autobiography about people's unwillingness to change. He understood that accepting new ideas is difficult unless the situation forces it. How can we put ourselves in situations to force new ideas while remaining comfortable- or is that even possible. Perhaps it is the trickiness of situations that allow us to see situations in new light.</p>
<p>Franklin was a powerful man, yet he did not act is such a way. Franklin wanted everyone to accept an idea before it was put into practice. He was able to be convincing be trying to find what that person's individual interest or notion was. He then worked to tie that to the big picture.</p>
<p>Perhaps, we just lack that sort of big picture thinkers. Franklin was able to do a remarkable job of bringing everyone together without forcing one side to concede more than another. He wanted the largest benefit to the public in each situation.</p> </div><!-- entry-content -->
